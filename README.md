Hiya! I'm JustYourAverageGameDev, lead
developer of UNDERTALE: Twilight and a
few more projects. The main engine I
use to make games is GameMaker, but I
have some experience with JavaScript,
Python and C++, which I'm currently
learning how to use.
Here are the projects I'm a part of:
- Deltarune Internal Demons (coder,
  musician)
- Tales Between the Stars (coder,
  musician, writer)
- SWAPPED MYTH [currently on hiatus]
  (musician, writer, artist)
- FutureGamer25's Deltarune Engine
  (coder)
- UNDERTALE FIRST CONTACT modder
- Undertale the Writer's Scribe (coder)
- Undertale the Broken Future (coder,
  musician) -- TAKING A BREAK
